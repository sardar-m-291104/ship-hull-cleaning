# CORROSSSION DETECTION USING YONO 
#Ship hull maintenance and surveillance are critical in the maritime sector for guaranteeing operating efficiency and extending vessel lifespan. This project proposes a novel robotic system developed for autonomous ship hull observation and cleaning, designed to operate underwater with minimal human intervention. This innovative solution combines mechanical rollers and water jets to ensure thorough cleaning of the shipâ€™s hull, removing biofouling and debris effectively. The robot utilizes N52 permanent magnets for stable adhesion and precise movement along the curved hull surface. Advanced sensors, including ultrasonic and IMU modules, enhance navigation and obstacle detection, ensuring safe operation in complex underwater environments.
The robot features modular design principles for flexibility and ease of maintenance, with Industry 4.0 technologies like IoT and AI integration for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This project aims to improve ship efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and minimize environmental impact by optimizing fuel consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with fouling.
